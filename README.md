About Moana
=====

Moana, an information-centric middleware for distributed services and applications. Moana offers a shared graph-based 
storage abstraction through which applications communicate with each other by appending and observing the shared graph. 

Moana supports two basic operations of ADD and MAP; add allows an application to persistently extend the global graph,
and map provides a dynamically maintained mapping of the global graph to an application specific, internal sub-graph.
